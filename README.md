# Modeling-and-Analyzing-Neural-Signals-with-Phase-Variability-using-the-Fisher-Rao-Registration
This project is to compare our Fisher-Rao registration framework to the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)  to analyze neural signals such as EEG and fMRI where phase variability plays an important role in the data. The code provided here illustrate comparisons with simulation examples.
